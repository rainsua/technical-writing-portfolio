# Portfolio / Manifest

### Status: [Stable]
**Maintained by:** Ramon A. Insua
**Environment:** VS Code (Strict Linting / Local Build)

### 1. Objective

This repository contains samples of some of my technical documentation. It aims to serve not only as a container of my samples but as a demonstration of my methodology. 

I subscribe to the view that documentation is the first line of defense. It is a security component, not unlike a firewall. When documentation has ambiguous language, it behaves like a vulnerability. When documentation contains clear language with strong meaning, it behaves like source of resilience.
----------------------------
This repository serves as a central index for my technical documentation and code samples. It is not merely a storage container, but a demonstration of methodology.

I believe that documentation is a security feature. Ambiguity creates vulnerability; clarity creates resilience. In my work, I prioritize detail, the distinct separation of instruments (functions), and an unyielding adherence to structure.

### 2. Operational Standards
All materials within this portfolio are constructed according to the following protocols:

* **The Diátaxis Framework:**
    Documentation is not a monolith. It is strictly segregated into four modes of operation to match user intent:
    * *Tutorials* (Learning-oriented)
    * *How-to Guides* (Task-oriented)
    * *Reference* (Information-oriented)
    * *Explanation* (Understanding-oriented)

* **Zealous Version Control:**
    Every commit is deliberate. I do not treat Git as a "save button," but as a forensic audit trail. History is immutable; changes are atomic.

* **Tooling & Integrity:**
    Authored within **VS Code** with a focus on clean syntax and portability. Dependencies are kept minimal to reduce the attack surface and ensure longevity.
