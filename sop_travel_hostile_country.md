## Digital Assets

Any valuable data, included but not limited to account credentials, files and crypto.

## Purpose and Scope

The following SOP is dedicated to any individual crossing borders where digital assets can be seized. At the moment, any foreign national passing through a border can be subjected to data searches. <!--Review this, not entirely happy about it>

## Burner devices

The easiest approach to protecting digital assets is not to expose them in the first place. That would imply taking a "burner" device (phone or/and laptop) with only mission-critical data. However, burner devices need to follow the same security guidelines as regular devices and for reasons of cost-effectiveness, are not suitable for all people and organizations. In the absence of a burner,  <!-- A burner device would be the ideal solution if it were the same quality as the actual device. Because business-grade devices are expensive, burner devices tend to be of lesser quality, adn as such have a the big trade-back "would this device allow me to work normally" and often the answer is not. There's another problem with burner devices and it is that border officials tend to distrust people who carry them, so unless they actually carry a mock alternate life, complete with messages, pictures etc, they can raise eyebrows. Of course, someone traveling in business could be excused for bringing an only "business" device? If that were the case the device would need to make a case with work files etc, showing that the individual carrying them is professional interested only in his/her work. talk more about burner devices>
