## Digital Assets

Digital assets are information in digital form. It is a broad term, encompassing text, audio and video files, account credentials, authentication tokens, certificates, passwords, seed phrases and anything of value that can be stored digitally. 
## Purpose and Scope

Follow this SOP to safeguard data across borders. Determine risk **diligently**. Most destinations are **medium-risk** but you must treat **medium-risk** as **high-risk** if you as a person are **high-risk**. Remember, **there are no low-risk destinations.**

## Raison d'tre

Data seizures and forensic inspection of digital devices across borders are rare but on the rise. These present a very high risk to individuals with valuable digital assets. Following this SOP will mitigate the risk of data loss/compromise in most casual inspections. In worst-case scenario it will provide the best chance of safeguarding mission-critical data. <!--Revise this section, might want to kill it or mutate it into something else>

## Modus Operandi

Reduce attack surface by taking **only mission-critical data** across borders. To achieve this, personal data that is not mission-critical must be removed from the devices that will travel. That is why using a travel specific device can simplify things considerably. 



Always prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

### Suitable Hardware

Only use either business-grade or enterprise grade laptops and phones. Consumer devices lack the security hardening and features to be suitable candidates.

**Ideal Phones:** All iPhones currently supported by Apple, i.e. receiving security patches, Samsung Galaxy phones currently supported by Samsung. These phones are enterprise-grade. Google pixel phones currently receiving security updates are also considered enterprise-grade, even if adoption is rare and availability isn't global.
These phones can be configured with hardened security settings to resist tampering somewhat, and keep data secure.

Apple iPhones, Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel are on a league of their own when it comes to security.

The same cannot be said about other Android phones, even models included in the Android Enterprise Recommended list.

**Business-grade Laptops:** Lenovo ThinkPads, Dell Pro/Pro Max (formerly Latitude and Precision) HP EliteBook and ZBook, MacBook Pro/Air.

**Enterprise-grade Laptops:** ONLY ThinkPad, EliteBook, ZBook, Dell Pro/Pro Max in addition to a number of rugged devices that should be avoided not because they lack anything but because they draw too much attention.

## Medium Risk vs High Risk

There is a huge difference between medium and high risk destinations. This document does not have a list of destinations with a risk-rating. Instead, a framework is provided to evaluate risk on an individual basis, and for individuals to act accordingly to protect themselves and their data. As of 9/11 and COVID, there are no longer *low-risk* destinations. Anywhere you go, your data and your personal liberties are at **at best** at medium-risk. There is not a single place on Earth where you can travel with the guarantee that your digital devices won't be subject of scrutiny. Nonetheless, **the difference between the lowest risk and the highest risk is abysmal** and **personal.** Even individuals working for the same company traveling to the same country can have **completely different risk profiles** in that country. As such, here are some guidelines to determine risk:

### The Economist Intelligence Unit Democratic Index

The Economist Intelligence Unit Democratic Index is a reliable source to determine the level of authoritarianism, and/or liberties warranted to according to the judicial framework of the country.

### Burner devices

For the purpose of this SOP a "burner" device is a travel-only device that will be sanitized when returned home. The device doesn't need to be destroyed after use, as a "genuine" burner used to be.

The devices used must meet security criteria listed before.

## Baseline security

We must establish a baseline security that should be met before considering traveling with the device at all, either in travel mode or not. Even without knowing

## Sanitizing a regular work/personal device for travel

Setting up business-grade hardware for travel is a straightforward process if baseline security is met from the beginning. 
In the absence of a burner, non-mission-critical apps and data must be backed up to a secure cloud and wiped on the device. This includes authentication apps and credentials. The creation of a travel password vault is **highly** recommended. This vault should include only passwords and credentials for mission-critical apps. 

 <!-- A burner device would be the ideal solution if it were the same quality as the actual device. Because business-grade devices are expensive, burner devices tend to be of lesser quality, and as such have a big trade-back "would this device allow me to work normally" and often the answer is not. There's another problem with burner devices and it is that border officials tend to distrust people who carry them, so unless they actually carry a mock alternate life, complete with messages, pictures etc, they can raise eyebrows. Of course, someone traveling in business could be excused for bringing an only "business" device? If that were the case the device would need to make a case with work files etc, showing that the individual carrying them is professional interested only in his/her work. in summation, the ideal burner is the same hardware as the actual working hardware, but without any data which is not mission-critical. As such, without factoring possible loss of the hardware, primary devices can become the perfect burner devices if non-critical data is removed. This is easier said than done. How do you remove MFA apps that you need to authenticate to important accounts? Modern life is incompatible with a burner device, you can't just remove authenticator apps, and you can't possibly even think about not using MFA on your accounts... So what can be done?  >

## Minimizing Risk according to destination

Here's are the risks associated with travel to certain areas:
### 1. USA
The risk when traveling to the US for private individuals and business travelers is political material. It can be as little as a whatsapp message criticizing the current administration. Border officials can ask for passwords and conduct manual searches. Failure to comply can lead to seizure of the device(s) and/or denial of entry into the country for non-US citizens/residents.

### 2. EEAA/Schengen

Though digital searches entering the EU are rarer, border officials have the power to search the devices upon suspicion of illegal IP items. They also have the power to seize devices. In the EU, crypto assets fall under funds that need to be declared theoretically upon arrival. However, at the moment, officials aren't equipped to value crypto, so this would only be enforced, theoretically, upon suspicion of a crime or terrorism.

### 3. Gulf States (Dubai, UAE, Saudi Arabia etc...)

Illegal items to bring to Gulf States (Dubai, UAE, Saudi Arabia etc...) include but are not limited to anything illegal. This includes pornography, gay paraphernalia, rainbows and many other "unacceptable" items. It's also illegal to bring over 10K in crypto currencies without declaring, IP infringement items and basically, everything risky in EU plus anything gay or porn.

## Password Managers for Travel

Theoretically speaking, any password manager can be used successfully if it's sanitized for travel. This means, only mission-critical passwords in the vault.

Create a new vault for travel only, and log out from the regular vault before departure. - Memorize your master password and don't write it anywhere. 
- A good master passoword (for your vault) should have six, truly random words. Do not capitalize. Do not use weird symbols. Use a passoword generator or EFF diceware.<!-- >
- The regular passwords in your vault should aim for 30 random characters. You do not need to memorize these, only the master password for the vault.
- Song lyrics, fragments from published books, composite words seemingly unreal or unheard off, or anything that can be predicted won't do. Good password cracking has lists of words, lists of words together with other words, lyrics, fragments of literature and anything you can think off. Humans are not very good at creating randomness. Use a password generator!

## Biometrics

Biometrics are invaluable for authentication. They're incredibly convenient and secure. However, when traveling to a high risk zone, biometrics should be disabled/deleted. Rely on alphanumerical passwords, passphrases and PINs. Remember, the most effective length for a passphrase or a PIN, is the one you can remember without fault, in your worst day under pressure, without hesitation. It's better to have 3three truly random words in a passphrase than 6 if you need to write them down somewhere just in case.
